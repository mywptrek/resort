    <h1> ABOUT US </h1></div>
    <div class="para-about">
    <p> Everyday life is filled with opportunities to seek the exceptional, encounter the new and widen our horizons. For our worldly guests, a stay at Anantara is just one more  chapter in a lifetime of travel and exploration. And we intend to make it an extraordinary one.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Anantara experience was born in 2001 with our first luxury property in Maldives’s historic seaside retreat of Hua Hin. From that day forward, we expanded throughout the world to beaches and private islands, countryside retreats, desert sands, heritage wonders and cosmopolitan cities. Today’s portfolio spans Asia, the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
     <br>
     <br>
     Our thoughtfully designed luxury hotels and resorts provide windows into the genuine modern character of each destination. Inside and outside each property, travellers engage with the places, people and stories that make the destination like nowhere else in the world. Guests curate a lifetime of memories through personal experiences, as Anantara opens doors and enables journeys of adventure and indulgence.
     <br>
     <br>
     Sprawling across 25 acres of lush greenery and set in soul-stirring ambience, Kumarakom Lake Resort, the winner of the much acclaimed World Travel Award as India’s Leading Resort for four years, exudes the charm of Kerala’s true heritage while offering a complete range of New Age amenities for a luxuriously comfortable stay.
